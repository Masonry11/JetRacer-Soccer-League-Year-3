# JetRacer-Soccer-League-Year-3

### Project Background
The third year of the JetRacer Soccer League Project is currently underway at the University of Washington as part of the ENGINE capstone course. The project team is tasked with building upon the previous two years' progress with the JetRacer cars and their equipment. The aim is to enhance the cars' autonomous soccer-playing capabilities by utilizing and expanding their onboard sensor suite. The project's objective for this year is to improve the cars' awareness of their surroundings to enable more complex play through sensor upgrades. The initial milestone is to showcase a one-on-one soccer match autonomously played by the cars. Success in this stage will lead to further enhancements and the goal of demonstrating a two-on-two match.

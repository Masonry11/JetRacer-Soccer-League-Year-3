# JetRacer-Soccer-League-Year-3

### Project Background
The third year of the JetRacer Soccer League Project is currently underway at the University of Washington as part of the ENGINE capstone course. The project team is tasked with building upon the previous two years' progress with the JetRacer cars and their equipment. The aim is to enhance the cars' autonomous soccer-playing capabilities by utilizing and expanding their onboard sensor suite. The project's objective for this year is to improve the cars' awareness of their surroundings to enable more complex play through sensor upgrades. The initial milestone is to showcase a one-on-one soccer match autonomously played by the cars. Success in this stage will lead to further enhancements and the goal of demonstrating a two-on-two match.

### Objectives and Goals
The project's goals include constructing and improving four JetRacer vehicles for soccer competitions, showcasing their present functionality and limitations, and enhancing the vehicles' sensory systems with additional hardware. Further objectives are to integrate these advanced sensors to strengthen the cars' operational performance and environmental perception. The cars will also be programmed to recognize and ally with team members to aid in scoring, as well as to identify and outmaneuver opposing players. Additionally, the project aims to enable the vehicles to discern various elements within the game, such as the ball, walls, and goals. Lastly, there is an objective to design a simple, portable soccer field for use in the competition, which is intended to be reusable and easily transportable.

### Deliverables
The deliverables for the project include a series of videos that demonstrate the remote-controlled cars achieving various milestones such as basic movement, image recognition, ball striking, and both cooperative and competitive interactions. Additionally, there will be an open-source guide on GitHub detailing the process for replicating the artificial intelligence agents designed to play soccer, as well as instructions for constructing the soccer arena and any required support equipment. The project will also deliver four JetRacer vehicles equipped with functional sensors and software, a soccer arena that is simple to reconfigure and portable, and a compilation of simulation and experimental data gathered during the project. A laptop containing all relevant files will be used to control the cars, and a comprehensive summary will be provided detailing the results and objectives met. Lastly, there will be a collection of requirements verification testing data, which will include video evidence of the JetRacers in operation and in competition.
